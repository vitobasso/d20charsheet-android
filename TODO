BUGS

    - skill list in Summary rolls to top when toggling conditions
    - can add the same skill/feat/temp effect twice
    - when has 2+ classes, class fields change when moving away from EditCharBasicFragment and back
    - nullpointer after renaming equiped weapon (at Attack.applyModifier, DAMAGE, getWeapon() is null)
    - can't remove trained skills (CAB + EditText bug)
    - null pointer after deleting item/feat/etc used by char
    - crash when editing entity w/ enum, when translated (can't find enum from translated string)
    - can't create new bonus (ability modifier): empty spinners


IMPROVEMENTS

# summary
    - ability damage
    - touch AC
    # breakdown
        - breakdown of composite attributes (critical, speed, damage, damage reduction)
        - show conditions on breakdown
        - show inactive conditions faded on breakdown
        - show race/class traits on breakdown
        - show dialog as balloon (http://www.londatiga.net/it/how-to-create-quickaction-dialog-in-android/)

# edit char
    - multi select on CAB

# edit
    - filter type options upon selecting target
    - show NumberPicker when touching EditTexts with a plain integer?
    - custom keyboard on fields: damage, critical?
    - create modifier w/ conditional
    - field for skill name on "edit temp effect" & "edit item"
    - show weapon properties as mods in "select item"
    - show slot descriptions on "edit item"

# items
    - item models (long sword vs. long sword +2)
    - filter by weapon vs sheld, 1 vs 2handed, melee vs ranged

# conditions
    - remove "against" from csvs
    - inheritance
    - order by parent


FEATURES

    - import/export
        - import char
            - msg to the user if there's no app to handle import/export (make suggestions)
    - port to tablet
    - baggage (+ weight calculation)
    - spells
    - xp

REFACTOR

    - unify attribute calculation (summary and breakdown)
    - organize BreakdownDialog
    - matar resources compostos "Select Char", "Edit Char". concatenar resources simples.
    - control complexity in daos
        - "brief" queries (create separate BriefDaos?)
        - "new dao, try query, finally close" find a way to avoid this repeating pattern (dao wrapper?)
    - create a state machine to control AppGlobal/AppPreferences state vs navigation
