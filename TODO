IMPROVEMENTS

#summary
- ability damage
- touch AC

#summary breakdown
- breakdown of composite attributes (critical, speed, damage, damage reduction)
- show conditions on breakdown
- show inactive conditions faded on breakdown
- show race/class traits on breakdown
- show dialog as balloon (http://www.londatiga.net/it/how-to-create-quickaction-dialog-in-android/)

#edit
- filter type options upon selecting target
- show NumberPicker when touching EditTexts with a plain integer?
- custom keyboard on fields: damage, critical?
- create modifier w/ conditional
- separar ataques e links em outro pager: config/tweak/ajustes
- select by CAB multiple choice

#conditions
- animate when hiding/showing
- touch to hide/show

#temp effects
- field for skill name on "edit temp effect"

#items
- show weapon properties as mods in "select item"
- field for skill name on "edit item"
- show slot descriptions on "edit item"
- item models (long sword vs. long sword +2)
- weapon status modifier on edit screen
- filter by weapon vs sheld, 1 vs 2handed, melee vs ranged

#others
- parse modifiers w/ comma separated conditions
- mutually excluding conditions
- source book

#performance
- load partially on select activity (only id, name, effects). load the rest after selection. (specially classes/races which have traits)
- avoid full queries when opening char


BUGS

- skill list in Summary rolls to top when toggling conditions
- can add the same skill twice
- can add the same feat twice
- temp HP effect
- Barkskin doesn't parse
- when has 2+ classes, class fields change when moving away from EditCharBasicFragment and back
- nullpointer after renaming equiped weapon (at Attack.applyModifier, DAMAGE, getWeapon() is null)
- can't remove trained skills (CAB + EditText bug)
- null pointer after deleting item/feat/etc used by char
- crash when editing entity w/ enum, when translated (can't find enum from translated string)


FEATURES

- import/export
    - library
        - how to preserve char with dependencies to removed stuff?
    - char
- translate to PT
- port to tablet
- baggage (+ weight calculation)
- spells
- xp
- animal companion, mount, followers
- export to pdf


REFACTOR

- unify attribute calculation (summary and breakdown)
- organize BreakdownDialog
- ViewPager & Fragments without support library
- matar resources compostos "Select Char", "Edit Char". concatenar resources simples.
